This is minimum runtime and start routine for Rust programs on WCH CH32V103 and is forked from [riscv-rt](https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv-rt).

CH32V103 has QingKe V3 RISC-V processor. the processor has RV32IMAC ISA and doesn't support Supervisor mode. So, most of codes not used on this processor is removed.

Please also refer original [README](README_riscv-rt.md) and [its repository](https://github.com/rust-embedded/riscv-rt).

Finally I am very happy to receiving any comments and advices.

Thank you
